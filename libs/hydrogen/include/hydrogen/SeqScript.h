/**
 * The SeqScript is how the sequencer communicates events to sequence
 * output clients.  It communicates a series of SeqEvents (typically note on/note
 * off stuff).  Each event is indexed with an offset to the first frame of the
 * current process() cycle.
 *
 * The SeqScript is primarily intended for triggering events in the
 * sampler.  However, it could easily be used to drive midi output, or multiple
 * sound generators, or loggers, etc.
