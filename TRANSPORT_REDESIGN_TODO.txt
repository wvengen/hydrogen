TO-DO LIST FOR TRANSPORT REDESIGN
=================================
2009-04-27

REDESIGNING THE REDESIGN
------------------------

This list is a specific list of things that should be done as a result
of the mailing list discussion from 24 July 2009 through August 2009.

(.) Time to rename several of the new classes.  SimpleTransportMaster,
    JackTimeMaster, JackTransportMaster, H2Transport... these names
    aren't communicating what they're supposed to be communicating.

(.) Most transports are implemented with a d-pointer.  I think this
    is overkill.

(.) While on the subject, review the use of the d-pointer to see if
    it's appropriate where it's used.... and if there's anywhere
    else that we should use it.

(.) Documentation describing role and requirements of a Transport
    implementation are scattered.  They all need to be collected
    somewhere conspicuous... like Transport.h.

(.) Change TransportPosition::bbt_offset to a floating-point type.
    We need something more determinate than dithering.  The dithering
    is hard for creating reliable tests, too.

(.) Change how notes are scheduled and rendered.  There's still some
    discussion (or uncertainty) of how flexible (and accurate) we want
    notes to be scheduled.  Currently, notes are scheduled by frame,
    which does not render correctly in the event of a tempo change.
    On top of that, Gabe would like to see the user have the ability
    to schedule lead/lag by tick or millisecond.  The reason for this
    is so that Hydrogen will do the Right Thing if the tempo (or even
    sample rate) changes.  Also, raw inputs (like MIDI) are still
    frame based.  Why should they be burdened with ticks?  Currently
    leaning toward scheduling by floating-point tick, only... but also
    considering some tri-state variable.

(.) I think my diagrams have arrows that are opposite of what you're
    supposed to do in UML.  Need to change those.

INLINE TODO MARKERS
-------------------

While coding, these are the markers used for "FIX ME LATER":

    #warning "SOME MESSAGE ABOUT FIXING THIS LATER"

    assert(false)

    // TODO: some message

    /* TODO: some message
     */

As of this writing (2009-05-25), the status is:

    #warning:       13 locations
    assert(false):   6 locations
    TODO comment:   19 locations

SPECIFIC TASKS
--------------

(.) Implement support for audio sample rate (currently
    hard-coded to 48000 Hz).

(.) Get pattern mode and the "loop" setting working.
    Currently, things are hard-coded to loop a song.

(.) At beginning of a song, the "Rewind" button causes
    a crash.  At the end of a song, "Fast-Forward"
    causes a crash.

(.) Re-implement Pattern mode with new transport.  This is
    what hydrogen.cpp lacks to compile.  (Update 2009-04-28:
    pattern mode added, but realized late that I also need
    a "stacked" pattern mode... which still needs to be
    implemented.)  (Update 2009-04-29:  The stuff was
    implemented, but not tested as of yet.)

(.) Create unit tests for as many classes as possible.

(.) Re-implement randomization logic (do this in
    hydrogen.cpp:audioEngine_song_sequence_process())
    This includes humanization, random pitch, lead/lag, etc.

(.) Implement a loop counter in TransportPosition.  The running
    clock in the UI will probably want this.

(.) Implement the Song->Jack Transport mapping in JackTimeMaster.

(.) Integrate songhelpers.cpp into H2Core::Song.

(.) Delete this file when all the tasks are complete.  :-)
