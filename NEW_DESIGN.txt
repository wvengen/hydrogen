THE NEW TRANSPORT AND AUDIO ENGINE DESIGN
=========================================

ABSTRACT
--------

The purpose of this file is to clearly communicate the intent and new
relationships of the Transport and Audio Engine redesign of 2009.  Whereas
TRANSPORT_REDESIGN_NOTES.gmb represents the evolution of thoughts and ideas
regarding the design... this reflects the *decisions*.  When decisions change,
this file is updated to reflect the current decision.

The Sequencer becomes the central information router.  What *was* the
audioEngine_process() callback will effectively become Sequencer::process().
The Sequencer::process() method will resemble the JACK call graph, like the
following pseudo-code template.

int Sequencer::process(uint32_t nframes)
{
    UPDATE TRANSPORT POSITION;

    PROCESS INPUTS;
    PROCESS OUTPUTS;
    DO MIXER PROCESSING;

    NOTIFY TRANSPORT NUMBER OF FRAMES PROCESSED;
    return 0;
}

A Sequencer Input is a Song or a Midi Device.  An Output is an Audio Device or a
Midi Device.  However, this scheme makes it easy to plug in new I/O, be it OSC,
GUI input, a logger, audio IN-put, etc.

The intention is that the Sequencer only thinks in terms of audio frames for the
current and next few process() cycles.  The inputs may refer to the transport
position to map their clocks and models to frames.  Then, it feeds events to the
sequencer with timestamps that are offset from the first frame of the current
process() cycle.

The sampler routes the events from the Sequencer and triggers the instruments
accordingly.  The instruments feed their data to the mixer, which mixes all th
signals for the audio outputs.  (**)

The so-called "Hydrogen API" is how the Hydrogen GUI interfaces with the audio
engine.  The public interface of H2Core::Hydrogen becomes the basis of the
public API.  Any classes that are part of this interface become part of the
public API.

While the GUI needs to manipulate every parameter, the intention is that the
classes of the public API be *Interfaces*.  That is, pure virtual classes.  The
implementations can be chosen and mixed by Hydrogen without disturbing the GUI
code... even at run time.  In some cases it may make more sense to feed heavy
objects to the API... but it's still the goal.  This may also make other
front-ends (e.g. CLI and plug-ins) more feasible.

(**) It's worth noting that from the Sequencer to the output of the mixers, the
processing is highly parallel number crunching.  If this proves to be a
bottle-neck, it's possible to implement parallel processing here for the
instruments and the mixer.

THE TRANSPORT
-------------

A conceptual model of the transport looks like this:

     HydrogenApp
        A
        |                                              Current Song
        V                                                     |(**)

        A                                           A         |
        |                                           |(**)     |
        V                                   (++)    |         V
  Transport <-- TransportMasterInterface <-+-InternalTransportMaster
     | (private)                           |
     |                                     +-JackTransportMaster (++)
     V                                     |                     
TransportPosition (Struct/class)           +-MiscTransportMaster
            | (analog to jack_position_t)  |
            |                              .
            V                              .
    Sequencer and friends                  .
                        (**) Currently, the Current song is a module
                             variable (private) for hydrogen.cpp.
                             How do we expose this to the transport?
                        (++) Someone, somewhere, has to compensate
                             for these cases:
                             * When jack_position_t does not have BBT.
                             * When ticks don't match Hydrogen's ticks.

Hydrogen will create and own the transport.  It allows the GUI to
manipulate it through the TransportMasterInterface.  This tranposrt is
not very smart at all, but serves as a front to several different
Transport implementations.  One key thing to notice in this: The
Sequencer is *always* a transport slave.  It is unable to change the
position of the transport without going through the transport's public
interface.  Furthermore, it has *no* idea who is controlling the
transport (whether it's Hydrogen or JACK or something else).

The transport implementations are required supply Bar:Beat.Tick (BBT)
data that maps the first frame of the audio cycle to a BBT.
Furthermore, the BBT has to match the current song or pattern that is
being played (depending on the mode).  So, this means that when we
reach the end of the song and start looping -- it starts feeding
1:1.0000 at the loop point.  This also means that if some external
transport gives some crazy BBT data (or *no* BBT data), that this has
to somehow be mapped in to something that is sane for the current
song.

InternalTransportMaster is just a concept for now.  The plan is to
start off with a simple implementation (i.e. no tap-tempo).  Once
working, we can provide some tap-tempo models without having to modify
the code, and we can even change/test the different implementations at
run-time.

Also, by modularizing these, it's much easier to write unit tests to
ensure that the transports will follow certain rules.

The names "Master" are a little confusing when you think in terms of
being the Jack Transport Master.

THE JACK TRANSPORT
==================

When Hydrogen wishes to be the JACK Transport master, it must be done in a
special way.  The JACK API provides a funtion for (optionally) taking control of
the JACK Transport.  However, it does *not* provide any means of notification
that you are no longer the transport master.

Therefore, we can *never* make any decision based on whether or not Hydrogen is
the JACK transport master.  Furthermore, when Hydrogen wishes to be the
transport master, it works like this:


                                        .....................
  Song ---> JackTransportCallback ----->.                   .
                                        . jackd             .
  Transport <-- JackTransportMaster <---.                   .
                                        .....................

In this way, our JackTransportMaster "driver" has no clue who is really
controlling the JACK transport.  Meanwhile, the JackTransportCallback is mapping
the current Song to the Jack timeline.

THE SEQUENCER
=============

The Sequencer requires inputs to convert their data into an event that
will be put in a queue (SeqScript).  The queue will be fed to
Sequencer output, which is to respond to the events.  This is very
much like MIDI.  The Sequencer::process() should look something like
this:

    sequencer_process(uint32_t nframes)
    {
        SeqScript seq;
        TransportPosition pos;
        SeqInputInterface* pSongSeq;  // i.e. Song -> SeqEvents
        SeqInputInterface* pMidiInput;
        SeqInputInterface* pGuiInput;
        SeqOutputInterface* pSampler; // i.e. H2Core::Sampler
        SeqOutputInterface* pMidiOut; // i.e. H2Core::MidiOutput

        // Get events from input sources

        pSongSeq->process(seq, pos, nframes);
        pMidiInput->process(seq, pos, nframes);
        pGuiInput->process(seq, pos, nframes);

        // Send events to the ouput clients to be processed.

        pSampler->process(seq.begin_const(),
                          seq.end_const(nframes),
                          pos,
                          nframes);
        pMidiOut->process(seq.begin_const(),
                          seq.end_const(nframes),
                          pos,
                          nframes);

        seq.consumed(nframes);
    }

    SeqOutputImplementation::process(SeqScriptConstIterator beg,
                                     SeqScriptConstIterator end,
                                     const TransportPosition& // pos //,
                                     uint32_t nframes)
    {
        // Do not use pos if you can help it!!
        SeqScriptConstIterator k;

        for( k=beg ; k != end ; ++k ) {
            // process events
        }
    }

Nobody is able to alter the tranport position, and the outputs are
unable to alter the input script.

Inputs *are* allowed to schedule beyond the current process() cycle.
This allows for things like lookahead (for humanization).

This is quite a bit different from how Hydrogen currently does things.
Currently, H2Core::Instrument mostly holds parameters and data that
the Sampler accesses to render the notes.  In this design, most of the
audio code is now *leaving* the sampler, and the sampler is like a
drummer hitting a stick on different instruments.

Likewise, the current H2Core::Mixer is a set of parameters that the
Sampler refers to when scaling and summing notes.  In this case, the
Mixer becomes the audio output device for each instrument.  The mixer
combines and routes signals as needed.

It's worth noting that once the sequencer is given the list of events
to render... the processing lends itself to parallel processing.  None
of the instruments really need to know anything about the other
intruments during this phase.
