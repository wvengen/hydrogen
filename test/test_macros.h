/*
 * test_macros.h
 *
 * These macros are primarily intended to make writing tests more
 * uniform and straightforward.  Using them is optional, but highly
 * encouraged.
 *
 * A nice side-effect of using these macros is that it abstracts out
 * the testing framework that is being used.  However, that is not the
 * intention.  For example, it's perfectly fine to use the
 * BOOST_MESSAGE() macro, or anything else the BOOST framework
 * provides.
 *
 * To use it, make a copy of t_Foo.cpp.template and season to taste.
