     * NOTE ON COMPARING FRAMES AND FRAME ADJUSTMENT
     * =============================================
     *
     * Suppose you are summing x(n+1) = x(n) + e where x(i) and e are real
     * numbers, and x(0) is known.
     * 
     * If you calculate like this: x(n+1) = round(x(n) + e) you will
     * consistantly drift away from the actual answer.  However, this is
     * common to do in frame adjustment calculations where the tempo does
     * not align with the frame rate.  The maximum error in this situation
     * is 0.5 * n.
     *
     * To mitigate this error (without keeping track of decimal
     * bbt_offsets), TransportPosition uses dithering.  A random number
     * between [-.5, .5) is added to the number before rounding.  So:
     *
     * x(n+1) = round( x(n) + e + dither() )
     *
     * Theoretically, all of the dither()'s should sum up to zero and you
     * would (usually) have no error over large 'n'.  However, it's not
     * exactly the case.  In order to have tests that always pass, it
     * would be nice to know what the tolerance is for error when
     * comparing expected frame values to calculated frame values.
     *
     * To find a boundary for the error introduced by dithering (as
     * opposed to the error introduced by rounding), I ran about 5000 sets
     * with e between 0 and 11, and max n = 100000... taking the maximum
     * errors for various slots.  (E.g. max error for n = [90, 100])
     *
     * I hand-fit [1] a couple of equations that always bounded the data.
     * They are as follows:
     *
     *     max_err = 2.1 * Nops^.50   { Nops in [0, 400] }
     *     max_err = 4.3 * Nops^.435  { Nops in (400, 100000] }
     *
     * Tabulated, here's what this function evaluates to:
     *
     *     MAXIMUM FRAME DRIFT (+/- frames)
     *     ================================
     *      Nops  | dither | no dither
     *     -------+--------+-----------
     *          1 |    2.1 |        1
     *         10 |    6.6 |        5
     *        100 |   21.0 |       50
     *       1000 |   86.8 |      500
     *      10000 |  236.3 |     5000
     *     100000 | 1751.7 |    50000
     *
     * Note that these are WORST CASE.  It is typically much better.
     * (E.g. over 100 ops I usually get 4.5 frames of drift). [2]
     *
     * [1] "Chi-by-eye."
     *
     * [2] As it happens, the fractional part of 'e' is the biggest factor
     *     the determines how much error you will get.  If e is close to a
     *     whole number, you will get very little error by dithering.
     *     When e is midway between two numbers, you are more likely to
     *     get larger errors.
